Details

A starter ruby file for this assignment is available here: https://gist.github.com/dummied/ead724f82a46a83473d1ed0acd3e6f70

## Explorer Mode
A ruby file called lipsum.rb that can be run from the command line using ruby lipsum.rb <argument>.
When run, it will output to the command line the ipsum wanted.
There should be at least three different options for the produced lipsum.
If no argument is given, or if the argument is unrecognized, it should output a helpful message to the user, and perhaps list of the available options.
Your GitHub repo should have one file: lipsum.rb.
## Adventure Mode
Sometimes, I might want more than one paragraph of dummy text. Make it so I can pass a second argument for how many paragraphs of text I want. It should still run with no second argument and default to a single paragraph. Of note: This can be the same paragraph repeated multiple times.
Epic mode
Hard mode, plus:

Make it so I can run it directly without the ruby in front. As in: lipsum.rb <argument> <argument>
Make it so it also copies the raw text to my clipboard. Hint: Take a look at the system method. On a Mac, pbcopy copies whatever is passed to it to your clipboard.
Possible Lipsums

Rather than write the dummy text yourself, I suggest you grab them from any of the following:

 - The Old Fashioned
 - Hipster
 - Samuel L. Ipsum
 - Fillerama
 - NotLoremIpsum

Of note: For Adventure mode and on, don't worry about getting fancy, just spit out the same paragraph multiple times.
